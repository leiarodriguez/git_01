’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  
All mimsy were the borogoves,

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->


Beneath the vast and endless sky,  
Where seagulls soar, and waves roll high,  
There lies a world of mystery and grace,  
A boundless realm, an endless embrace.  

The ocean's depths, a hidden treasure trove,  
Where secrets lie in the coral grove,  
A tapestry of life in every hue,  
From the tiniest plankton to the mighty blue.  

The sun-kissed surface, a shimmering dance,  
As sunlight weaves its golden trance,  
Sparkling diamonds on the water's crest,  
A tranquil haven where sailors find their rest.  

But beyond the beauty, a tempest's roar,  
The ocean's fury, its mighty core,  
In storms it rages, with thunderous might,  
Challenging all who seek its endless fight.  

Yet even in its chaos, a wondrous sight,  
The power and majesty of nature's might,  
For in the storm's heart, a lesson learned,  
That strength and beauty can coexist, undiscerned.  

Oh, ocean vast, a world so grand,
